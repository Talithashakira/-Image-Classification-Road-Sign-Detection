# ðŸš¦ Image Classification: Road Sign Detection

Welcome to my image classification project focused on detecting and classifying **traffic signs** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **TensorFlow**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Traffic signs play a crucial role in maintaining safety and order on the roads. However, real-world conditions like lighting, angle, and image quality can make these signs appear differently. This project builds an image classification model using **Computer Vision** and **CNN** to automatically recognize 17 types of traffic signs from images.

The goal is to support intelligent vehicle systems, smart city projects, or traffic education apps with fast and accurate sign recognition.
